# Kraving

Kraving is a local-search service powered by crowd-sourced review forum that lets users review individual menu items in restaurants.

## Background and Overview

Sometimes when someone craves a specific menu item, they do not necessarily care about general restaurant reviews provided on platforms such as Yelp.

For example, if someone craves the best burger in town, they do not necessarily care about how good a restaurant's hot dog is. In this case, they have no choice but to go by word-of-mouth, or read through thousands of reviews to get the consensus.

**Kraving** seeks to make the experience of finding that best burger smoother by provide a platform for people to review individual items.
